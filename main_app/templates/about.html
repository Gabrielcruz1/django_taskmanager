        This Task Manager application was built using Python, Django, HTML, and CSS. This web-based platform is meant to
        help users manage their daily tasks and projects. This application allows users to create tasks and set due
        dates for their priorities. It features a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily view, add, and
        update their tasks. The use of Django as the backend framework allows for efficient database management and
        dynamic rendering of HTML pages with CSS styling. With its intuitive design and robust functionality, this Task
        Manager application can help users stay organized and on top of their workload.
